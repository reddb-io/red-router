# @reddb-io/red-router

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 7464ebd: Data dir moves to `~/.red/router` with the database at `~/.red/router/data.sqlite` (matching the `.red/*` ecosystem layout). One-time migration chain imports existing data from `~/.red-router` (previous layout, including the old `db/data.sqlite`) and from the official 9router origin (`~/.9router`, whose `db.json` is imported into SQLite). `DATA_DIR` env override still wins.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 069bbd4: Headless background service + docs: `red-router service install|status|uninstall` runs the gateway under systemd --user (Linux) or launchd (macOS), surviving reboots and crashes. Services bind 127.0.0.1 by default; `--expose` (or `-H 0.0.0.0`) opens the gateway to the subnet. READMEs now teach the `npx -y @reddb-io/red-router@latest` flow.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- aed0607: Fix CLI app failing to boot from the npm package with MODULE_NOT_FOUND react/react-dom (follow-up to the @swc/helpers/@next/env fix). The standalone bundle now ships react and react-dom too, and the release boot smoke test now packs the real tarball and boots it from an isolated directory so it can no longer pass by resolving dependencies from the workspace.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 30545ee: Fix CLI app failing to boot from the npm package (MODULE_NOT_FOUND @swc/helpers / @next/env). Next.js standalone output under pnpm misses runtime-only deps that npm traces in; the CLI build now copies them into the bundle and a boot smoke test gates every publish.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ef0d26a: Port upstream data-safety and stream/translator robustness fixes:
  
  - **Database safety**: fail closed before any schema mutation on a corrupted SQLite database; prevent silent database wipe with startup quick_check
  - **OAuth**: parse numeric epoch expiresAt so imported connections still refresh
  - **Streams**: terminate streams that end without a finish_reason; Ollama NDJSON no longer blocked as non-SSE (VS Code chat streaming fixed); commandcode retries transient stream errors instead of emitting fake stop chunks
  - **Translator**: deduplicate/repair repeated tool call arguments; recover tool results that arrive without a call id; keep Responses tool-output images as images; stop emitting literal think tags on Claude→OpenAI; preserve optional tool parameters and function-tool strict across Responses/Codex; repair trailing assistant prefill instead of dropping it; placeholder for binary tool_result blobs; emit max_completion_tokens for gpt-5/o-series; strip output_config.format for Claude-compatible gateways; decloak tool names on claude→claude and same-format OAuth streams
  - **Claude**: drop the diagnostics body field rejected by Anthropic

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ff56e4: Port upstream fixes and features:
  
  - **Combos**: merge member capabilities into combo `/v1/models` entries — boolean features are unioned, numeric limits minimized, nested combos flattened; thinking levels for suffixed ids resolve through the clean model
  - **Capabilities**: OpenAI reasoning models cannot disable thinking (levels drop "none"); o-series globs no longer capture Cline's Solar Pro 4
  - **Translator**: repair tool_call_id lost by Responses clients; preserve function-tool strict across Claude/Chat routes
  - **Catalog**: register the renamed deepseek-flash id; pricing gains missing long-context tiers
  - **Dashboard**: surface why a provider connection test failed

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 68ff9aa: **Breaking**: the default port changed from `20128` (source dev: `20127`) to **`25050`**. Update clients/tools pointing at the old port, or pass `--port`/`PORT` explicitly.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 61edd85: Expose `thinking_levels` per model and LLM combo in `/v1/models` and `/v1/models/info` (intersection across members for combos), and accept thinking-suffix overrides on combo names: `my-combo(high)` applies the level to every routed member, clamped to each member's supported levels.
