/**
 * Should the health sweep write a terminal `expired` / `no_refresh_token` state?
 *
 * #5326 established the rule: a refresh-capable provider whose connection has no
 * refresh token can never self-heal, so surface that as terminal instead of
 * leaving `testStatus: "active"` disagreeing with the dashboard's expiry badge.
 * That holds for providers whose OAuth flow ALWAYS mints a refresh token — a
 * missing one there really is broken auth.
 *
 * It does not hold universally (#14261). Some refresh-capable providers also issue
 * long-lived credentials that are refresh-less BY DESIGN: `claude setup-token`
 * mints a 1-year token with no refresh token and no stored expiry. Those were
 * condemned within one 60s tick of a successful request, then re-condemned after
 * every self-heal, because absence of a RECOVERY mechanism was read as evidence of
 * expiry.
 *
 * For those providers, gate on the same field the badge reads
 * (`tokenExpiresAt || expiresAt`): with no known expiry the badge cannot claim
 * "Token Expired" either, so there is no mismatch to correct and condemning the
 * row is pure loss. Where an expiry IS known and has passed, the terminal write
 * still happens and #5326 is preserved.
 *
 * @param conn Provider connection row.
 * @param supportsRefresh Result of `supportsTokenRefresh(conn.provider)`, injected
 *   so this stays pure and unit-testable without the provider registry.
 * @param nowMs Current epoch ms; injected for deterministic tests.
 * @returns true when the sweep should mark the connection expired.
